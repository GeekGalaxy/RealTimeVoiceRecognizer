#RealTimeVoiceRecognizer

Speech recognition application which uses private Google API to convert voice speech into text notes.

## What can it be used for?

I created this application in 2011 with using C#, WPF and some of knowledge in C# and Win API interoperability. The main goal was to create application for making fast text notes during Skype calls and meetings. Also I thought it can be helpful for disabled people after improvements in this software.
